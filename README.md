This repository contains the model of the Pisa/IIT hand as described in:

## Dependencies

ToDo: Create a travis.yml file for this.

You need the forked version of ros_control where the adaptive synergy transmission is implemented:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/ros_control.git
cd ros_control
git checkout multi-robot-test
```

## Examples
There are several [examples](https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/pisa-iit-soft-hand/tree/master/examples) that show how the hand can be used in different configurations.

###Push the finger (Not implemented)

Test the adaptive synergy transmission by applying a wrench to the middle fingertip (you must choose start_time and duration according to the ROS time clock)

```
rosservice call /gazebo/apply_body_wrench "body_name: 'soft_hand::soft_hand_middle_distal_link'
wrench:
  force: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 10.0}
  torque: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}
duration: {secs: -1, nsecs: 0}"
```

And clear the wrench in case you want to continue working normally

`rosservice call /gazebo/clear_body_wrenches "body_name: 'soft_hand::soft_hand_middle_distal_link'"`

## Hand configuration using QBtools (USB/Handle)

These packages assume you use qbTools to move the hand, since it is the electronics the hand is sold with.

So, ensure you have the correct configuration for the the hand to be used either through USB or with the handle (joystick) using [handmoveadmin](hand-tools/) tools.

Compile following instructions by [qbrobotics](https://github.com/qbrobotics/handadmin) and use:

`./handmoveadmin -p` <- To check the Input mode

`./handmoveadmin -m` <- To change the input mode

[0] is for USB communication.

[1] is for the handle.
